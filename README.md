What is RPA
RPA stands for Robotic Process Automation. It allows businesses to automate processes, so users can spend more time serving customers. RPA can range from simple things such as creating an automated response to an email or more complex things such as a robot that is programmed to complete tasks. RPA helps reduce costs and human error.
